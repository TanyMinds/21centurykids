**`Why are children stubborn?`** Because they are logical, and we, the parents, are often inconsistent. They do not know about the rules that society has "given" to us as something pre-established.

If the child asks "why don't we cross the street at the red light?", You can explain that a rule has been made for pedestrians and drivers. Let them pass one by one, lest they hurt one another.

But what do we do with the axiom "don't move while talking"? I didn't find a logical answer. Moreover, it has been shown that those children who move a lot, have a highly developed Kinesthetic intelligence and learn much more easily while moving.

How many, many more rules do we impose on children without being really logical: "don't shake hands", "don't talk loudly", "don't move so much", "be good"â€¦

Many of them have no relevance in certain circumstances. You simply want it that way, or think about what others around you will say about you as a parent.

What can we do?

We pass any statement through a filter before we say it.

How?

1. Say the statement in your mind.

2. Answer the question "why?", The child will definitely ask you.

    Even if you find an answer, repeat the question for the answer found, and you can do it several times in a row. Simulating the conversation with the child.

3. If at point 2 you found a logical answer, you have a green light. If not, it would be better to give up from the start, you and the child will feel better.

    Example:

    - We do not cross the street at the red light.

    - Why not?

    - We could be injured by a car

    - Why doesn't she stop?

    - There is an agreement created between pedestrians and drivers, as in games (here you can also give an example of a game, which the child knows), who and when passes so that accidents do not happen.

3. If you want each experience to be something to learn, you can let them know the answers in point 2 without being asked.

Be a consistent parent! Arm yourself with logic!
