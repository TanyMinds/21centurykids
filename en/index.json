[{"content":"The environment offered to the child is fundamental When parents have certain fears, limiting beliefs, children can’t be otherwise. They get the environment offered by adults, where they extract their information and behavior patterns. You can’t, for example, tell your child to be more empathetic, proactive, or sociable if you’re not. I mean you could, but the effect will be short or not at all. He needs a consistent behavioral example, in the desired direction, for long term results. Of course, it can be another family member or educator, teacher, coach…, who has a beneficial influence on the child, but also, in this case, the parent is who offered him the environment.\nIt is never too late in the education process It is very important to understand that in the education process it is never late. All it takes is the right attitude, desire for change, and development. The idea that you can’t make things right anymore doesn’t have to exist. If you have a small child, just start being the best version of yourself. To an older child, you have to explain the changes you make and why. Explain to him that you realized you’ve worked wrong in certain areas of life and want to improve them. That you want him, the child, to do it better than you do. You may need to apologize for certain behaviors and explain to him that you didn’t realize or otherwise you didn’t know how, but now you understand. You don’t have to be afraid to speak honestly to the child, he will feel the sincerity and the impact of the lesson will be even greater.\nEliminate limiting beliefs Once parents broaden their perspective and expand their limits, the children substitute that goal very quickly. They are like a vacuum just waiting to fill. Curiosity is natural and wants to continually conquer new territories.\nThe conclusion is, if you want children free, open-minded and happy, release yourself first, be open to change, don’t stop learning, and create your ability to be happy.\nPhoto credit: Tany Minds\n","id":0,"image":"images/blog/no-limits-children-parents.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"The environment offered to the child is fundamental When parents have certain fears, limiting beliefs, children can’t be otherwise.

Taking as an example the performances of other children in his entourage, friends, colleagues.\nQuestion: How would we, adults, feel if the boss repeated every day: \u0026ldquo;Look at your colleague Joana, how she performs, do as she do\u0026rdquo;?\nThe child feels the same way, when you always praise others in front of him, thinking that you give beautiful examples to follow.\nDid you forget that you have an unique child? There is no other child in the world with the same characteristics, although about one child is born every second.\nHow can we raise a child with self-confidence?   Analyze and find out what your child is good at and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t coincide with your vision of his future. He must learn to perform in something, later he will be able to copy the pattern in other aspects and areas.\n  Help him develop these skills or talents. First of all through positive and detailed encouragement regarding the skills we appreciate:\nWe don't tell the child: \u0026quot;you danced very well today\u0026quot;, but: \u0026quot;I like that you did very good pirouettes today\u0026quot;.\nInstead of: \u0026quot;you wrote beautifully\u0026quot; say, for example: \u0026quot;I like that you used paragraphs and you wrote very clean today\u0026quot;.\nThis way the child can become aware of the Strengths and understand what to work on.\n  Strengthen the results with love and quality time spent with your child.\n  P.S. It is good to work in a team with your spouse, grandparents, and relatives as much as possible, for lasting results.\nPhoto credit: stem.T4L on unsplash.com\n","id":1,"image":"images/blog/unique-kids-education.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Look at how well Emily wrote today, I see Samy is very good at football…\u0026rdquo;\nThus begins, in the opinion of many parents, the motivation of the child.","tags":null,"title":"Did you forget that you have a unique child? |Quick advice| ","uri":"https://21centurykids.com/en/blog/unique-kids-education/","year":"2020"},{"content":"Bold / Proactive Child or Good Child? We meet different opinions about these skills.\n  I want to have a bold child, so I allow him to behave with other people as he wishes. He does not want to respect, it is his choice!\n  Or the other way around, I want a good child who respects people and I force him to apologize every two minutes for every little thing.\n  The extremes in this case do not lead to anything good.\nIn the first case, a child will grow up who will not love anyone, but neither himself!\nAnd in the second case, an overly helpful child will grow up who will love everyone, except SELF!\nIn the relationship between the bold child and the good child, a balance is needed. Everyone should want a good child who is also proactive.\nHow can we have a proactive and good child at the same time?   Encourage the child to communicate what he wants when the problem arises Not with us but with the person concerned.\nE.g:\n\u0026ldquo;Hello, I would like to play a little with your car, instead you can play with mine.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd we are the ones who, for the beginning, must help them to formulate their wish correctly, so that the conflict does not appear.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s explain its meaning, by examples, what those limits of behavior are.\nE.g:\n\u0026ldquo;It is not good to hit children. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine, like your friend Samy, he will approach you right now and hit you with the car in the head, how will you feel? It will definitely hurt you and you will be angry with him, the same thing your friend will feel if you hit him \u0026ldquo;.\nThe child has no way of knowing how far the limits of common sense are and takes them from the environment. As he understands them, and not necessarily correctly.\n  In conclusion:\nHelp your child to formulate the wish very clearly and correctly and encourage him to communicate it to the one with whom he has a common interest.\nExplain to the child how far he can go with the wishes and exemplify each action. It is much easier for children to understand by example.\nLast but not least, strengthen everything by your own example! The child will not do what we say if our words contradict what we do!\nPhoto credit: Tany Minds\n","id":2,"image":"images/blog/bold-child-proactive-child-good-kid.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"Bold / Proactive Child or Good Child?

Because they are logical, and we, the parents, are often inconsistent. They do not know about the rules that society has \u0026ldquo;given\u0026rdquo; to us as something pre-established.\nIf the child asks \u0026ldquo;why don\u0026rsquo;t we cross the street at the red light?\u0026rdquo;, You can explain that a rule has been made for pedestrians and drivers. Let them pass one by one, lest they hurt one another.\nBut what do we do with the axiom \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t move while talking\u0026rdquo;? I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a logical answer. Moreover, it has been shown that those children who move a lot, have a highly developed Kinesthetic intelligence and learn much more easily while moving.\nHow many, many more rules do we impose on children without being really logical: \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t shake hands\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t talk loudly\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t move so much\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;be good\u0026rdquo;…\nMany of them have no relevance in certain circumstances. You simply want it that way, or think about what others around you will say about you as a parent.\nWhat can we do?\nWe pass any statement through a filter before we say it.\nHow?\n  Say the statement in your mind.\n  Answer the question \u0026ldquo;why?\u0026rdquo;, The child will definitely ask you.\nEven if you find an answer, repeat the question for the answer found, and you can do it several times in a row. Simulating the conversation with the child.\n  If at point 2 you found a logical answer, you have a green light. If not, it would be better to give up from the start, you and the child will feel better.\nExample:\n  We do not cross the street at the red light.\n  Why not?\n  We could be injured by a car\n  Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t she stop?\n  There is an agreement created between pedestrians and drivers, as in games (here you can also give an example of a game, which the child knows), who and when passes so that accidents do not happen.\n    If you want each experience to be something to learn, you can let them know the answers in point 2 without being asked.\n  Be a consistent parent!
